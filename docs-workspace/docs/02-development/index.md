# Development Section

This section contains active development tracking and control files for the IntelliFinance project using the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology.

## Subsections

### Control Files
Core SDD control files that govern the development process:

- **changelog.md** - Change history with context and traceability
- **plan.md** - Implementation task breakdown with effort estimates
- **specs.md** - Feature specifications and requirements
- **todo.md** - Idea inbox and quick notes
- **code-state.md** - Current architecture snapshot

### Roadmap
Feature timeline and development milestones.

### Dashboards
Development metrics, progress tracking, and quality indicators.

### Summaries
Phase summaries, conceptual notes, and development retrospectives.

## SDD Control Files

The control files are the heart of our development process:

1. **SPECS.md** - WHAT to build (requirements, not implementation)
2. **PLAN.md** - HOW to build (tasks, estimates, implementation approach)
3. **CODE-STATE.md** - WHAT exists (architecture, current state)
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - WHAT changed (history with context)
5. **TODO.md** - WHAT to consider (inbox for ideas)

## Audience

- **Internal use only** - Not published to GitHub Pages
- Development team members
- AI agents (Orchestrator, TPM/PO, Architect, Developer, QA, Writer)
- Project managers tracking progress

## Update Frequency

- **PLAN.md** - Daily as tasks progress
- **CODE-STATE.md** - Weekly or after architectural changes
- **CHANGELOG.md** - After each feature/phase completion
- **TODO.md** - Process weekly (Monday morning)
- **SPECS.md** - When requirements change or new features proposed
