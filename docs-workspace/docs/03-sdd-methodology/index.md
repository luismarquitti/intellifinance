# SDD Methodology

Welcome to the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology documentation for IntelliFinance.

## What is SDD?

Spec-Driven Development is a systematic approach to software development that emphasizes:

1. **Specification First** - Define WHAT before HOW
2. **Test-Driven** - Tests before implementation
3. **Gated Workflow** - Approval gates between phases
4. **Control Files** - Single source of truth for project state
5. **AI-Assisted** - Leverage AI agents for consistency

## Core Documents

- **overview.md** - Complete SDD methodology documentation
- **quick-reference.md** - Fast lookup for SDD processes
- **spec-driven-workflow.md** - Detailed workflow descriptions
- **integration-guide.md** - How to integrate SDD into your process
- **workflow-reference.md** - Step-by-step workflow guides

## Key Principles

### 1. Specifications Drive Implementation
Every feature starts with a spec in SPECS.md before any code is written.

### 2. Plans Break Down Specs
Architects convert specs into actionable tasks in PLAN.md with effort estimates.

### 3. Tests Precede Code
QA agents write failing tests before developers implement (TDD Red-Green-Refactor).

### 4. Quality Gates Required
All phases must pass quality gates before proceeding.

### 5. Documentation is Continuous
Writers document as work completes, not as an afterthought.

## SDD vs Traditional Development

| Aspect | Traditional | SDD |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Requirements | Upfront document | Living SPECS.md |
| Planning | Sprint planning | Continuous PLAN.md updates |
| Implementation | Code first | Tests first, then code |
| Documentation | End of cycle | Continuous CHANGELOG.md |
| Quality | Manual reviews | Automated gates + agent validation |

## Who Should Read This?

- Developers new to SDD methodology
- Project managers implementing SDD
- AI agents learning the development process
- Stakeholders understanding our approach

## Getting Started

1. Read [overview.md](./overview.md) for complete methodology
2. Check [quick-reference.md](./quick-reference.md) for daily usage
3. Follow [integration-guide.md](./integration-guide.md) to adopt SDD
4. Use [workflow-reference.md](./workflow-reference.md) as step-by-step guide
