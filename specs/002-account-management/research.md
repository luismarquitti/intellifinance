## 1. Frontend Component Library

*   **Decision**: Use Material-UI for the frontend components.
*   **Rationale**: Material-UI is a popular and comprehensive React component library that provides a wide range of pre-built components, ensuring a consistent and professional look and feel. It is well-documented and has a large community, making it easy to find support and examples.
*   **Alternatives considered**:
    *   **Chakra UI**: Another excellent component library, but Material-UI's more extensive component set is a better fit for this project.
    *   **Custom components**: Building custom components from scratch would be time-consuming and could lead to inconsistencies.
