# API Contracts

**Branch**: `001-monorepo-structure` | **Date**: 2025-11-27 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)

This directory is reserved for API contract definitions, such as OpenAPI (Swagger) or GraphQL schemas.

As per the feature specification (`spec.md`), user-facing business features and their corresponding API endpoints are **out of scope** for the initial monorepo setup.

This directory is therefore a placeholder for future work. Contracts will be added here as new features requiring API interactions are specified.
